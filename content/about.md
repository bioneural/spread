Synthetic intelligence. Bioneural architecture.

I build software and write about the decisions behind it. This site exists for ideas that need more structure than a commit message and more precision than a conversation.

The standard is completeness. Claims carry their derivations. When understanding changes, the text changes. What you read here is current.
