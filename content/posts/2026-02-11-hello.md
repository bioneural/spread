description: "The commitments that govern this space"

Software decisions are made in conversations that get archived and commits that strip the reasoning. The artifact survives. The thinking behind it does not.

This space preserves the thinking.

The infrastructure reflects the constraint: static HTML, system fonts, no frameworks. Kramdown converts markdown to pages. A single Ruby script builds the site. Minimal, because the writing is the point.

The name is a publishing term. A spread is the two facing pages of an open book — what you see when the binding is no longer in the way.

Three commitments govern what appears here:

**Precision over volume.** A post exists because the reasoning required room, not because a schedule required content.

**Show the reasoning.** Every claim is accompanied by its derivation. A precise question is as rigorous as a precise answer — but an assertion without either is not permitted.

**Revision over accretion.** When understanding changes, the text changes. What you read here reflects current thinking, not historical accident.
