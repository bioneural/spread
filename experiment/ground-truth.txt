# ground-truth.txt — maps query IDs to relevant cluster IDs
#
# Format: query_id<TAB>type<TAB>clusters<TAB>query_text
#
# Types:
#   single     — targets a single cluster via direct vocabulary
#   paraphrase — targets a cluster via semantic meaning, zero keyword overlap
#   negative   — nothing in the corpus is relevant (clusters = "none")
#
# Clusters:
#   1  Tool architecture decisions
#   2  Embedding model behavior and configuration
#   3  Prompt engineering and classifier tuning
#   4  SQL and database design patterns
#   5  Error handling and debugging stories
#   6  Ruby implementation details
#   7  Git workflow and CI decisions
#   8  Testing strategies and harness design
#   9  Identity and voice standards
#   10 Logging and observability
#   0  Noise (cooking, weather, geography, sports)
#
# Single-cluster target queries (10)
