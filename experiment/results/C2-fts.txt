- [2026-02-17 correction] Previously believed screen needed separate prompt templates per classifier. Wrong. One shared template with condition and input XML tags handles all three classifiers. The tuning target is the condition wording, not the template structure.
- [2026-02-17 error] book dispatcher crashed when a task payload contained a single quote. The SQL interpolation in store_result did not escape it. Fixed by running gsub("'", "''") on all user-supplied strings before interpolation.
