## Known facts

- prophet → does not → vendor (since 2026-02-17)

## Memory entries

- [2026-02-17 decision] core holds identity and voice standards in IDENTITY.md. Every repo references core as the canonical source. When the persona evolves, it evolves in one place. No copies. No drift.
- [2026-02-17 error] trick extracted 14 memories from a single transcript but 9 were trivial operational details like "edited file X" and "ran test suite." The extraction prompt needed stronger filtering language. Changed to: "Do not extract trivial operational details (file edits, command outputs, routine code changes)."
- [2026-02-17 decision] prophet does not vendor its dependencies. Each tool — hooker, crib, screen, trick, spill, book — lives in its own repo as a sibling directory. prophet discovers them at runtime via relative paths.
- [2026-02-17 note] hooker evaluates policies in priority order: gates first, then transforms, then injects. A gate halt stops the chain. Transforms and injects both fire on the same event.
