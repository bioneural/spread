## Memory entries

- [2026-02-17 decision] core holds identity and voice standards in IDENTITY.md. Every repo references core as the canonical source. When the persona evolves, it evolves in one place. No copies. No drift.
- [2026-02-17 note] The gemma3:1b model says yes to anything technology-adjacent when given vague conditions. A meeting agenda mentioning "vendor API" classified as source code. Specificity in the condition wording is the only fix — the model cannot self-calibrate.
- [2026-02-17 decision] prophet does not vendor its dependencies. Each tool — hooker, crib, screen, trick, spill, book — lives in its own repo as a sibling directory. prophet discovers them at runtime via relative paths.
