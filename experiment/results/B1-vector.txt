## Memory entries

- [2026-02-17 error] trick extracted 14 memories from a single transcript but 9 were trivial operational details like "edited file X" and "ran test suite." The extraction prompt needed stronger filtering language. Changed to: "Do not extract trivial operational details (file edits, command outputs, routine code changes)."
- [2026-02-17 error] book dispatcher crashed when a task payload contained a single quote. The SQL interpolation in store_result did not escape it. Fixed by running gsub("'", "''") on all user-supplied strings before interpolation.
