## Memory entries

- [2026-02-17 decision] crib uses consolidation-on-write rather than periodic garbage collection. When a new triple contradicts an existing one, the old relation gets valid_until set to now. No background jobs. No scheduled cleanup. The write path keeps the archive clean.
- [2026-02-17 decision] prophet does not vendor its dependencies. Each tool — hooker, crib, screen, trick, spill, book — lives in its own repo as a sibling directory. prophet discovers them at runtime via relative paths.
