## Memory entries

- [2026-02-17 decision] prophet does not vendor its dependencies. Each tool — hooker, crib, screen, trick, spill, book — lives in its own repo as a sibling directory. prophet discovers them at runtime via relative paths.
- [2026-02-17 decision] Switched spill from per-tool log files to a single SQLite database. Centralized logging means one place to query when debugging cross-tool failures at 3 AM.
