- [2026-02-17 note] The gemma3:1b model says yes to anything technology-adjacent when given vague conditions. A meeting agenda mentioning "vendor API" classified as source code. Specificity in the condition wording is the only fix — the model cannot self-calibrate.
- [2026-02-17 correction] Previously believed screen needed separate prompt templates per classifier. Wrong. One shared template with condition and input XML tags handles all three classifiers. The tuning target is the condition wording, not the template structure.
